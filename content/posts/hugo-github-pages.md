This site is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a static site generator. The site is hosted on Github pages which is free while staying under some user [limits](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits).

The goal of the tutorial is to keep the static webpage in a git repository. When any changes are made and pushed to a specific branch, the site will be built and deployed automatically to Github pages.

## Getting started with Hugo

Hugo has a great getting started [tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) at their website. Once you have installed Hugo you can bootstrap a project with the following command:

```shell
hugo new site <name-of-your-project>
```

You need to provide Hugo with some configuration, create a file called `config.toml` in your project root directory and put the following content in:

```toml
baseURL = 'https://<your-git-username>.github.io/<git-repo-name>/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = Your site title
publishDir = "."
```

Then you can add some content to your website with:

```shell
hugo new posts/hello-world.md
```
If you add some content to the created markdown file, like so:

```plain
---
title: "Hello World!"
date: 2022-03-28T20:10:16+02:00
draft: true
---
This is my first content!
```
You can start a server locally that hosts the webpage at [localhost:1313](localhost:1313) and you can preview your content! ðŸŽ‰

## Building site on pushes

In order to have the website built when a push is made, we need to create a Github workflow. Create a yaml-file in the `.github/workflows/` like so:

```sh
mkdir .github/workflows && touch .github/workflows/build.yaml
```

Put the following content into the file:

```yaml
name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - <your-branch-name>
  pull_request:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: "."
```

## Setting up the repository

Let's push this to Github, create a public repository for our code at [https://github.com](https://github.com).

Then go to the repository settings and head to the "Pages" options, specify which branch that Github should host, and the root for the website. Pick "/" for the website root. As for the branch pick your prefered branch name. 

Then we can push our content to it:

```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
git push -u origin master
```

Head over to your repository and you should see the build and deployment actions being triggered. Once they finish you can visit the hosted website at:

`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/posts/<hello-world>/`
